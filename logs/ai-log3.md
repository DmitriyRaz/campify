# Campify Auth Domain Implementation Log

## Session Summary

Today we focused on implementing the login component for the Authentication domain of our Campify application using the Domain-Scoped Vertical Slice Architecture. We successfully created the core components for the login functionality and set up the font integration.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Login Component Implementation
- Created the LoginForm component with proper structure and styling
- Implemented SocialLoginButton component for Google and Apple login options
- Created InputField component for username and password fields
- Added show/hide password functionality
- Structured the form with proper validation attributes

### 2. App Router Integration
- Set up the login page at `/app/auth/login/page.tsx`
- Configured proper imports from the domain components
- Established the pattern for thin App Router with business logic in domain components

### 3. Font Configuration
- Integrated Urbanist font family using next/font/google
- Added proper configuration in the root layout
- Updated tailwind.config.js with font family settings
- Identified and addressed CSS specificity issues with font application

### 4. Design Alignment
- Made several adjustments to match the provided design mockups
- Refined spacing, colors, and component sizing
- Ensured responsive layout for mobile devices 

## Technical Considerations
- Followed Domain-Scoped Vertical Slice Architecture principles
- Kept business logic in domain components
- Used typed interfaces for component props
- Implemented proper state management with React hooks
- Set up form validation structure

## Next Steps
- Fix mobile, and make signup, and onboarding

## Component Structure

```
src/
└── domains/
    └── auth/
        └── components/
            ├── LoginForm.tsx       # Main login form component
            ├── InputField.tsx      # Reusable input field component
            ├── SocialLoginButton.tsx  # Google/Apple login buttons
            └── index.ts            # Barrel exports for components
app/
└── auth/
    └── login/
        └── page.tsx               # Thin wrapper for login page
```

The session provided a solid foundation for the Authentication domain, following the architectural patterns outlined in the project specifications.
