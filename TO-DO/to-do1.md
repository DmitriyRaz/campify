# Next Steps for Campify Development

After completing the initial project setup with our Domain-Scoped Vertical Slice Architecture, the following steps will establish our development workflow and implement our first domain.

## 1. CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

Before diving into domain development, we should establish proper CI/CD to ensure code quality:

### GitHub Actions Setup
- Create `.github/workflows` directory
- Add CI workflow for feature branches:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ 'feature/**', 'bugfix/**' ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ development, staging, master ]

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint
  
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: lint
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
```

### ESLint and Prettier Configuration
- Configure ESLint rules for consistent code style
- Add Prettier for automatic formatting
- Set up husky pre-commit hooks to run linting before commits

### Testing Framework Setup
- Configure Jest and React Testing Library
- Add basic testing utilities and mocks
- Create test script in package.json

## 2. Auth Domain Implementation

Our first domain implementation will be authentication, as it's foundational for the application:

### Component Structure
- Create base components in `src/domains/auth/components`:
  - `LoginForm.tsx`: Email/password login form
  - `RegisterForm.tsx`: New user registration
  - `OnboardingFlow.tsx`: Post-registration onboarding
  - `AuthCard.tsx`: Container for auth forms

### State Management
- Implement auth state store in `src/domains/auth/store/authStore.ts`:
  - User authentication state
  - Login/logout actions
  - Registration actions

### Supabase Integration
- Create auth service in `src/domains/auth/services/authService.ts`:
  - Supabase authentication methods
  - Session management
  - User profile handling

### Page Implementation
- Create page components in `src/domains/auth/pages`:
  - `LoginPage.tsx`: Complete login page implementation
  - `RegisterPage.tsx`: Registration page
  - `OnboardingPage.tsx`: New user onboarding

### Route Configuration
- Set up auth routes in `src/app/(auth)`:
  - `/login` route
  - `/register` route
  - `/onboarding` route
- Add auth-specific layout if needed

## 3. Shared Components Development

Develop shared components needed across domains:

### UI Components
- `Button.tsx`: Reusable button component with variants
- `Input.tsx`: Form input component
- `Card.tsx`: Container component for content
- `Alert.tsx`: Feedback component for user notifications

### Layout Components
- `GlobalPageWrapper.tsx`: Main application layout wrapper
- `SideBar.tsx`: Navigation sidebar
- `TopBar.tsx`: App header with user profile

## 4. Workflow Patterns

Establish patterns for domain development workflow:

### Feature Development Process
1. Create feature branch from development: `feature/domain-name/feature-name`
2. Implement core components, services, and state management
3. Create page components that compose functionality
4. Write tests for critical paths
5. Open PR to development branch
6. Review and merge once CI passes

### Domain Integration Pattern
- Keep cross-domain dependencies explicit and minimal
- Use shared services for communication between domains
- Document domain boundaries in README files

## 5. Authentication Middleware

Set up authentication middleware to protect routes:

- Create `src/middleware.ts` for Next.js middleware
- Implement route protection for dashboard routes
- Set up authentication redirect logic

## 6. Test Account Setup

Configure test accounts in Supabase for development:

- Create admin test user
- Create standard test user
- Document login credentials in development docs (not in repo)

## Next Domain Roadmap

After completing the authentication domain, proceed with:

1. Dashboard domain - Core metrics and navigation
2. Leads domain - Lead management functionality 
3. Products domain - Product catalog features

Each domain should follow the vertical slice pattern established in the auth domain implementation.
